              Since I was in elementary school, I've always been fiercely passionate about software engineering. When I was in the 4th grade, I built my first text adventure game using Batch, but quickly transitioned to scripting utilities for my day-to-day computer use.

              Of course, I didn't stay limited to Windows scripting for long. In the years following, I worked for <a href="diamondsystems.com">Diamond Systems</a>, where I developed device-level Linux drivers, as well as competing in the FIRST Robotics Competition where I worked on framework code in Java, C, and C++ in order to control our robot using control loops running at 200 Hz on severely limited hardware. I also worked with a friend to develop an automatic scheduler for our community college. <a href=jarvis-scheduler.herokuapp.com">Jarvis</a> was developed in Python and helped us and many of our peers design our course schedules.

              Even though I've left high-school, I remain involved with <a href="valkyrierobotics.com">Valkyrie Robotics</a>, a Cupertino-area nonprofit organization offering hands-on technical experience for local high schoolers, including running its own FRC team. On team, I've continued my work on framework code, as well as developing complex controls algorithms and teaching them to the kids in order to control the manipulators on the robot.

              In my near future, I plan to graduate from Georgia Tech and pursue a job in embedded software engineering.
